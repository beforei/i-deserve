	<p>A global conversation based around each individuals view of entitlement.</p><br>
	<p>The purpose: to gain a better understanding of each other as individuals</p> 
	<p><em>not</em> through marketing demogrpahics or political lines.</p><br>
	<p>The hope: that through open conversation about our expectations and belief in entitlement</p>
	<p>we may become a stronger species and learn better how we may affect the world around us.</p><br>
	<p>Without further ado,</p>
	<p>Welcome to i-deserve.</p>
